					<h2>Reflection on Professional Conduct</h2>

					<p>Professionalism in the IT industry isn’t just about knowing how to code it’s about how you carry yourself in team settings, how you meet deadlines, and how you treat others. Throughout this module, I’ve aimed to act in line with the BCS Code of Conduct, particularly around integrity, respect, and continuous improvement.</p>
					
					<h3>Examples of Professional Conduct</h3>
					<ul>
					  <li><strong>Group Leadership:</strong> I’ve led multiple group projects this year taking responsibility for assigning roles, setting deadlines, and making sure everyone had input. This has shown I can communicate effectively and act as a reliable team member.</li>
					  <li><strong>Engagement & Attendance:</strong> I attended every lab and workshop, contributed to discussions, and submitted work on time. Even when group members were struggling, I made the effort to check in and keep the momentum going.</li>
					  <li><strong>Respect & Inclusion:</strong> I always made sure every group member’s opinion was heard, even if I disagreed. I encouraged quieter team members to speak up, because a solid team needs everyone on board.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
					<ul>
					  <li><strong>Handling Pressure:</strong> During stressful weeks with lots of deadlines, I sometimes left tasks too close to the deadline. I’m learning to pace myself better and use time management tools more consistently.</li>
					  <li><strong>Giving Constructive Feedback:</strong> I’ve realised that while I’m good at encouraging others, I sometimes avoid giving honest feedback to avoid tension. I want to improve my ability to offer helpful critique in a respectful way.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>Setting Professional Standards</h3>
					<p>Moving forward, I want to set a high standard for myself in everything I do especially if I want to work at top-tier companies like Rockstar. Professionalism is more than behaviour in a classroom, it’s about how I present myself in interviews, how I collaborate in fast-paced environments, and how I handle setbacks.</p>
					
					<p>I’ve started researching real-world professional conduct expectations in tech from forums like Stack Overflow to articles on sites like TechRepublic and the BCS (British Computer Society). I’ve learned that adaptability, communication, and respect are as valuable as technical skill, especially in game development where team collaboration is constant.</p>
					
					<p>This reflection has helped me realise that professional growth is a continuous process and I'm committed to levelling up just like I would in a game: day by day, with intention and effort.</p>
