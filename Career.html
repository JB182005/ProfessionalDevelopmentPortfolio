									<h2>My Career Aspirations</h2>
									<p>My goal is to become a professional game developer, ideally working at an industry-leading company like Rockstar Games, or Insomniac. I want to help create fun, engaging, and meaningful games that people across the world enjoy. Long-term, I want to launch my own gaming company and build titles that push creativity and storytelling.</p>

									<h3>Inspiration from Industry Experts</h3>
									<p>One guest lecture that really stood out to me was by <strong>Paul Bailey</strong> from SPARCK, who spoke about the power of effective web design. He covered topics like intuitive navigation, accessibility, and creating engaging user experiences all things that directly apply to game development too. It made me realise that good UI/UX design isn’t just for websites; in games, things like menus, HUDs, and interfaces all need to feel natural and fluid for players. Paul’s insight inspired me to think more critically about the player journey and how I can design game elements that not only look good but actually enhance the overall experience. That’s something I’m eager to bring into the games I develop in the future.</p>


									<h3>Industry Research</h3>
									<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the demand for skilled developers in the UK gaming sector is growing fast, especially with companys seeking talent proficient in C++, Unity, Unreal Engine, and agile development methods. Rockstar's own job postings often list these skills as essentials, along with soft skills like problem-solving and adaptability.</p>

									<h3>Skills Required for My Career</h3>
									<ul>
									<li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Python (my strength), HTML/CSS (currently improving), plus future focus on C++, Unity and Unreal Engine.</li>
									<li><strong>Teamwork & Communication:</strong> Leading group projects and assigning roles has already developed my leadership skills.</li>
									<li><strong>Creative Thinking:</strong> I’m always coming up with ideas for mechanics, characters and game features a skill that’ll be crucial when pitching concepts or designing gameplay loops.</li>
									<li><strong>Professionalism & Time Management:</strong> A key area I’m working on. Timely delivery and accountability will be essential in studio work.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Why This Career Fits Me</h3>
									<p>I’ve always loved interactive media growing up playing games like Club Penguin, Fifa and GTA showed me how games can entertain, educate, and bring people together. As someone who enjoys storytelling, building things, and working in a team, game development feels like the perfect mix of passion and purpose.</p>
