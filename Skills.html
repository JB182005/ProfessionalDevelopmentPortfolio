							<h2>Analysis & Evidence of My Current Skills</h2>
							<h3>Technical Skills</h3>
							<ul>
							  <li><strong>Python:</strong> This is my strongest language I’ve completed multiple projects, including a personal finance manager and game mechanics prototypes. I’ve used it in coursework and personal projects.</li>
							  <li><strong>HTML/CSS:</strong> I'm comfortable creating structured pages and basic styling, but I'm actively working to improve responsiveness and design. This portfolio website itself is part of that journey.</li>
							  <li><strong>Other Tech:</strong> I’ve earned Microsoft Office Specialist certifications in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, which support report writing, presentations, and planning.</li>

<p>
  For my major dev projects, I built two games from scratch using Python and Pygame—one’s a 2-player anime-style fighting game, and the other’s a 2D side-scrolling shooter packed with action, AI, and explosions. Both games showcase how far I’ve come with game development and my ambition to enter the industry.
</p>

<h3>Anime Street Fighter Game</h3>
<p>
  Inspired by classics like Street Fighter and Jump Force, this 2-player fighting game lets users pick between Naruto and Luffy in a head-to-head battle. I built character classes, implemented collision detection, health bars, animated sprite sheets, special moves, and more. The game starts with a clean main menu and features a pause screen with video/audio settings and key binding options.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Character classes with health, movement, and special moves</li>
  <li>Animated sprite sheets with punch, kick, block, and jump mechanics</li>
  <li>Sound FX for attacks and background music for immersion</li>
  <li>Score tracking and a round-based win system</li>
  <li>Custom menus and pause functionality with options</li>
</ul>

<h3>2D Shooter Game</h3>
<p>
  This game is all about action. You're a soldier dropped into enemy territory with limited ammo and grenades. Enemies shoot on sight, there's water that'll kill you, and items scattered around to boost your health and supplies. It includes multiple levels built from CSV files and even a custom level editor.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tile-map based world with platforming, AI enemies, and environmental hazards</li>
  <li>Player can shoot, throw grenades, and collect pickups</li>
  <li>Multiple levels with increasing difficulty and a clear exit goal</li>
  <li>Sound FX for everything gunfire, jumping, dying and background music</li>
  <li>Custom level editor where users can make and save their own maps</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Both games pushed my coding ability, design skills, and creativity. They’ve been a launchpad for my future in game dev. Whether it’s enemy AI, responsive menus, or sprite animations.
